Take a photo of the sky to identify the weather 
In China, there is a word called "Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning. Red sky at night, sailor's delight."
So I catch up a thought: why we cannot use our mobile and combine the information of weather report supported by some weather app and make the prediction more accurate.
